- 👋 Hi, I’m @aarondcruz
- 👀 I’m interested in econometric and financial modelling and all things data! As Arthur Conan Dyle once wrote, "Data, data, data, you cannot make bricks without clay!"
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science and computer science topics like machine learning and AI models to further bolster my interest in data science and analytics
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project that would analyse macroeconomic effects of major crisises such as COVID-19 or the Great Recession 
- 📫 How to reach me you can reach me at aaron.dcruz277@gmail.com ~
